# NRC20-logos (development)
Repository to store NRC20 token logos
* The NRC20 token logos will be used by several clients such as Nordic Energy block explorer when displaying the infomations of NRC20.


## Steps to add your NRC20 logo
* Fork this repository
* Add your logo by creating the logo image name using your NRC20 contract net-address and placing it inside `NRC20/`, e.g. `NRC20/net1pdv9lrdwl0rg5vglh4xtyrv3wjk3wsqket7zxy.png`
* Append your NRC20 token's basic information (including address, name, symbol, decimals, totalSupply, description, website) to the bottom of the list.json,

For example, append yours to the last lines of [list.json](https://github.com/nordicenergy/NRC20-logos/blob/master/list.json)

```
